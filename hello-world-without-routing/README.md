## Getting started

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/inpercima/swaaplate-hw
cd swaaplate-hw/hello-world-without-routing

# install tools and frontend dependencies
yarn
```

Create environment files for `devMode` and `prodMode`.

```bash
cp src/environments/environment.ts src/environments/environment.dev.ts
cp src/environments/environment.ts src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

**Note**: These files will not be under version control but listed in .gitignore.

## Usage

### Recommendation

It is recommanded to use a server to get full access of all angular.
For the other options your app should run on a server which you like.

### Run in devMode

```bash
# build, reachable on http://localhost/app/path/to/dist/
yarn build:dev

# build and starts a server, rebuild after changes, reachable on http://localhost:4200/
yarn serve:dev

# build, rebuild after changes, reachable on http://localhost/app/path/to/dist/
yarn watch:dev
```

### Package

```bash
# build in prodMode, compressed
yarn build:prod
```

### Tests

```bash
# test
ng test

# e2e
ng e2e
```

## Configuration

### General

All options have to been set in the environment files but some of them do not need to be changed.
All defaults refer to the environment file (`environment.ts`), they are prepared in devMode (`environment.dev.ts`).
Change for prodMode the option `production` to `true`.
